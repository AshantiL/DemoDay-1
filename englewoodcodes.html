<h4> I really enjoyed this program, it was very beneficial. Before this program, I wasn't interested in computer sciences, but this program has opened my eyes to a whole new world!
i learned how to make websites using basic html and css coding. The expericence of being in englewood codes was very fun. I enjoyed being around other teens from the same area as me and comming together to learn something foreign to what we usually learn in school. 
i feel that this program taught me somethimng that can benefit the whole city. every teen in chicago should know about this program, because not only we're learning the something fun, we're learning something that we can use in the future and make a wonderful living for ourselves. Because of Englewood Codes, I am now considering going further in learning about code and majoring in Computer sciences when I get to college.</h4>
