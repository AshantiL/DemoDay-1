 <h4 align="center"> if i told you you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, 
would you trust it? would you trust me and believe that 
i turned out to be a positive, intelligent,and integral young lady dispite
 the fact that I was born and raised on the southside of chicago, 
to many of you it might be the last place you would go due to all
 the senseless violence that goes on here, but to me, its home. 
its hard not to get caught into all the violence and its even harder to actually 
make something out of yourself. Its hard, but no one ever said it was Impossible.
 My name is Dallas Battle, I am 16 years old with a upcomming bithday this fall.  
i live in the West Englewood area of the southside of Chicago, AND PERSONALLY, 
I LOVE MY CITY. i mixed with A mother That is African American & A father that is Puerto Rican, so of course, I am a honor student attending  
Team Englewood H.S. this fall,
i will be a junior, and i am estatically looking foward to that. i Ended my freshman & sophomore year with all honors and A.P. classes.
I love to learn new things, because i a a strong believer in education setting you free.
I Love to Dance. That is my passion, but between school, family, and a heap of other things, I dont have a lot of time on my hands to do that.
After i graduate from highschool. I Want to attend a 4 year universty. I'm not sure which one yet though.
I also want to attend cosmetology schhol and become a licends beautician,makeup artist, and nail tech.
Thats my other passion, beauty. I' m always trying to do a friends makeup. I lovethe feeling doing hair and makeup 
as much as i love to dance, i love the way it gets my mind off daily stressors and puts my mind on the beauty.
In the future, i aspire to be a CEO of my own  skin & earth friendly cosmetics line. I dont fear the new economy, i am the new economy.
