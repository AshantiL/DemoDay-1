 <h4 align="center"> If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, 
would you trust it? Would you trust me and believe that 
I turned out to be a positive, intelligent,and indispensable young lady despite
 the fact that I was born and raised on the southside of Chicago, primarily the Englewood area.
To many of you, It might be the last place you would go due to all
 the senseless violence that Takes place, but to me,Its home. I personally LOVE MY CITY.
its hard not to get caught into all the violence and It is even harder to actually 
make something  of yourself. i Will.
 My name is Dallas Battle & I am 16 years old. My mother is African American & My father is Puerto Rican, so of course, I have the best of both worlds. 
Team
I am a Honor student at TEAM Englewood Highschool, and I am estatically looking foward to my junior year. My first two years of highschool, I had all honors and A.P. classes.
I love to learn new things, because I strongly believe education will set you free.
I love to Dance, do hair, makeup, and nails , those are my passions.
After i graduate from highschool, I Want to attend a four year universty.
I also want to attend cosmetology school and become a licensed beautician,makeup artist, and nail tech.
both passions takes my mind off daily stressors and puts my mind on the beauty of it
In the future, I aspire to be a CEO of my own  skin & earth friendly cosmetics line. I dont fear the new economy, I am the new economy.
